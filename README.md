Quizzing Bricks iOS application
==================

##Testing
If you wish to test the application as is, then first go to your local Apple Store. If you live in Sweden and outside of Stockholm, you might want to consider ordering online or going to another certified apple seller.. 
Next, you'll need Xcode 5.0 and the iOS 7.0 SDK.
Open the project in Xcode and hit Run.
Most of what you see is just proof of concept and doesn't actually do much, but you can navigate your way to the game board by hitting "Log In", "Current games" and "Game #1". You'll be presented with the gameboard and clicking once on any cell will turn it greenm another click will turn the cell blue and a final click will send you right back where you started at a gray cell.

The current high score is non existent.. why are you bothering testing the application at this stage. Go read a book. I recommend The Wheel of Time series.. epic as fuck.

##Features
###Game Board
The so far most complete part of this application is the gameboard, it doesn't actually do much but it serves as a proof of concept and allows us to see how the game might look at the end. 

###Registration Login
Promised this sprint.. we'll see.
